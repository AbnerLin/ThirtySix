# ThirtySix
The ThirtySix is the web-base application for restaurant which can monitor meals serving status, customer check in/out from seat map in real-time without refresh page.

## Features
* Customer Check-in/out.
* Order the meal, and update the serving status.
* Arrange seat map by self.
* All of information about customer, meals will display on seat map in real-time dynamically.

## Explanation
This project is just the prototype, I only implement the main flow about seat map arrange, meals serving status, and customer check in/out features. The CMS about update menu and image are not implement yet, UI too.
